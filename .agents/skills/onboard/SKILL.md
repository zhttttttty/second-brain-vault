# Onboard a New User

Guide a new user through a short, friendly initialization. Keep the entire experience simple and concise. Do not create a Daily Note or modify personal context files.

## 1. Check initialization state

Read `AGENTS.md`, then run this read-only command from the Vault root:

```text
python .agents/skills/onboard/scripts/cleanup_examples.py --list
```

The output distinguishes files to delete (`DELETE`) from README files to update (`UPDATE`). Treat the numeric `TOTAL` line as the initialization signal.

- If `TOTAL=0`, say only that initialization is already complete, then suggest filling in `01_Context/About_Me.md` and `01_Context/Current_Priorities.md` or running `/card-creator`. Stop there.
- If examples exist, continue with the onboarding flow.

## 2. Welcome the user

Open with this concise welcome and do not expand it into a longer introduction:

> 欢迎来到 DailyUp Second Brain，从这里开启你的第二大脑！今后，这里将成为你与 AI 一起学习、思考和创造的长期工作空间。

## 3. Give a minimal guided tour

Read the files that exist from the lists below. Present each selected file as a clickable path with one short sentence explaining what it demonstrates. Do not summarize its full contents.

Core entry points:

- `QUICK_START.md`
- `01_Context/About_Me.md`
- `01_Context/Current_Priorities.md`

Representative examples:

- `02_Daily/_EXAMPLE_2025-01-01.md`
- `03_Projects/_Example_Project/Project.md`
- One `_EXAMPLE_*` file from `04_Knowledge/00_Cards/`
- `04_Knowledge/01_Topics/_EXAMPLE_Learning_Science.md`
- `05_References/01_Inbox/_EXAMPLE_clip.md`

Keep the tour compact: group the core files together and the examples together.

## 4. Ask before cleanup

Show the complete target list returned by `--list`. Clearly distinguish example files that will be deleted from README files whose example references will be removed. State both totals and ask one direct question: whether to perform the complete cleanup now.

Stop and wait for the user's answer. Do not interpret silence, ambiguity, or an unrelated reply as consent. Do not run any deletion command in the same turn that asks for confirmation.

The cleanup scope must remain limited to:

- `_EXAMPLE_*` entries found by the helper in its designated template directories
- `03_Projects/_Example_Project/`
- Example-specific references in the README files reported by the helper

Never delete other paths merely because their names contain `example`. Do not remove unrelated README content.

## 5. Handle the answer

If the user clearly confirms, run:

```text
python .agents/skills/onboard/scripts/cleanup_examples.py --clean --yes
```

Report how many example files were deleted, which README files were updated, and whether any targets remain. If cleanup fails, preserve the error details and do not improvise broader deletion or editing commands.

If the user declines, do not delete anything. Mention that `/onboard` can be run again later.

In either case, close with two next steps:

1. Fill in `01_Context/About_Me.md` and `01_Context/Current_Priorities.md`.
2. Run `/card-creator` to create a first knowledge card.

Mention `/today` only as an optional next step for planning the day and creating the Daily Note.
